> ***Note:*** _This lab should be done with your Project 3 team._

## Exercise

With your team, you will create a project proposal that ties together everything that you’ve learned and defines your vision for your third project. Use your user goals and feature prioritization to construct a project proposal that distills down your point of view and outlines how you intend to complete your final project.

Finish prioritizing your list of features that you are planning to build out for your Project 3 app, if you have not completed that process already.

Create a slide deck that outlines your team's vision for your third project. How can you meet user needs while also providing a unique vision, based on what users value and what’s happening in the competitive space?

In the last 25 minutes of class, each group will present their pitch. One team member should project the slides on the screen, and everyone should present at least one portion of the pitch. Each group will have 7 minutes to present.

#### Requirements

Take one hour to create a project proposal slide-deck that answers the following questions:

- What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible? ([Problem Statement](https://github.com/ga-adi-macaron/Course-Materials/tree/master/lessons/product-development/design-thinking-and-ux-lesson#independent-practice-creating-a-problem-statement-5-mins))
- What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned. ([Research Highlights](https://github.com/ga-adi-macaron/Course-Materials/tree/master/lessons/product-development/user-personas#guided-practice-practice-synthesizing-research-15-mins))
- Who is your target audience? ([User Personas](https://github.com/ga-adi-macaron/Course-Materials/tree/master/lessons/product-development/user-personas#independent-practice-create-personas-from-project-interviews-30-mins))
- What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen. ([Feature Prioritization](https://github.com/ga-adi-macaron/Course-Materials/blob/master/lessons/product-development/feature-prioritization/README.md#group-practice-prioritize-your-project-3-features-20-minutes))
- How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed? ([Competitive Analysis](https://github.com/ga-adi-macaron/Course-Materials/tree/master/lessons/product-development/competitive-research-lesson#introduction-competitive-analysis-15-mins))
- Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
- Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you’re proposing?

Take this lab seriously. Your ability to work effectively as a team hinges on how organized you are. The more thought you put in to the presentation, the easier it will be to divide up the work of implementing your app and keep everyone working toward the same vision.

Consider giving each group member 1-3 slides to work on so you can combine your efforts. Also, be sure to tap into your work from the last few days - research plan, personas, prioritization.


#### Deliverable

Create a presentation deck - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint - of at least 7 slides that answers the questions above. Include images, if appropriate. Submit the deck (or a link to it) via pull request to this repo. Only one team member needs to submit a pull request - put all team member names in the pull request title.
